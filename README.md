# mnd-multiobject-detection
This project is an early-stage exploration into how machine learning and computer vision might assist in the early detection of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) - specifically through **facial landmark analysis**. Inspired by research from the Rob Burrow Centre, it combines technical learning with a personal interest in healthcare innovation.
